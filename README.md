A project in react that demonstrates the building of a futuristic card design, featuring the Dji Mavic Air 2S, that utilizes advanced CSS and JavaScript techniques such as 3D transforms and hover interactions to create an immersive and interactive user experience. The card includes elements such as an image, text, and a button, that all move in a 3D space when hovered over, giving the impression of a dynamic and engaging design. The project aims to showcase the potential of modern web development and design, and inspire others to push the boundaries of what is possible with web technologies.
